@article{wang_spillover_2023,
	abstract = {Extreme weather anomalies, energy crisis and environmental degradation have garnered significant attention in the context of sustainable development. This paper analyses the spillovers among climate policy uncertainty (CPU), energy prices, green bond index, and carbon emission trading price with quantile connectedness approach. The results suggest that connectedness among variables is higher at the extreme quantiles than the median quantile, and the connectedness would strengthen during international events, such as the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, COVID-19 epidemic, and Russian-Ukraine conflict. Additionally, the dynamic spillover analysis further demonstrates that CPU consistently acts as the risk receiver and passively bears influence from other markets. The constructed theoretical mechanism provides valuable insights for a comprehensive assessment of climate policy, facilitating the orderly functioning of energy, green finance and carbon markets, and sustainable investment. Thus, the paper concludes that the significant spillover from energy, green bond and carbon markets serve as useful indicators for judging and predicting uncertainties related to climate policy.},

@article{baker_measuring_2016,
	abstract = {We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency. Several types of evidence---including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles---indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.},

@article{REN2023113058,
	abstract = {Extreme weather anomalies act as threat multipliers, warning us to focus on low-carbon transition and sustainable development. This study analyses the dynamic bidirectional causality between climate policy uncertainty (CPU) and traditional energy, represented by oil, coal, and natural gas, as well as green markets, represented by clean energy, green bonds, and carbon trading. This research provides the first comprehensive assessment of CPUs across multiple dimensions of different energy properties, causal spillover directions, and temporal heterogeneity using the time-varying Granger test. The results indicate that significant dynamic causality exists within each series rather than the entire period, and that causality manifests differently between pairs of series. In addition, CPU is more inclined to act as a risk recipient than a sender in the market volatility spillover. Whenever extreme climate events or major climate policy changes are encountered, the causal relationship between CPU and the relevant markets will rise significantly. Overall, governments should pay attention to the role of climate policy implementation in energy transition as well as attempt to reduce uncertainty.},

Our results indicate that the effects of geopolitical and financial uncertainties on commodity dynamics are concentrated in the short-term, and commodity volatility is more affected than returns. The volatility of commodity futures responds differently to different types of financial uncertainty shocks, and the uncertainty shocks caused by financial stress have produced relatively large effects, especially since the global financial crisis. Furthermore, our findings contradict traditional wisdom, as we observe that the uncertainty shocks caused by financial liquidity lead to increased commodity returns only in the short term. There are obvious heterogeneity responses of commodity futures in different sectors to uncertainty shocks. Energy and industrial metals are more affected than other commodities. Our findings are an important reference for decision makers and investors.},

@article{bakas_impact_2018,
	abstract = {In this paper, we empirically examine the impact of uncertainty shocks on the volatility of commodity prices. Using several alternative measures of economic uncertainty for the U.S., we estimate their effects on commodity price volatility through VAR analysis. We find that the latent uncertainty shocks have the most significant impact on commodity price volatility when compared to observable measures of economic uncertainty. In specific, our results show that the unobservable economic uncertainty measures of Jurado et al. (2015) have a significant and long-lasting positive effect on the volatility of commodity prices. Our findings indicate that a positive shock in unobservable macroeconomic and financial uncertainty leads to a persistent increase in the volatility of the broad commodity market index and of individual commodity prices, with the macroeconomic effect being more significant. Finally, we show that the impact is stronger in energy commodities compared to agricultural and metals markets.},

@article{babar_returns_2024,
	abstract = {Purpose This study investigate the return and volatility spillover among agricultural commodities and emerging stock markets during various crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian war. Design/methodology/approach This return and volatility spillover is estimated using Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) approach. Findings The results reveal the weak connectedness between agricultural commodities and emerging stock markets. Corn and sugar are the highest and lowest transmitters, respectively, whereas soya bean and coffee are the largest and smallest recipients of spillover over time. Most equity indices are the net recipient except for India, China, Indonesia, Argentina and Mexico, during the entire sample period. Most commodities are net transmitters of volatility spillover except coffee and soya bean. At the same time, major equity indices are the net recipient of the volatility spillover except for India, Indonesia, China, Argentina, Malaysia and Korea. In addition, the return and volatility spillover increase during various crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian war, but the major increase in spillovers occurs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Practical implications The empirical results show a weak relationship between agricultural commodities and emerging stock markets which is helpful for investors and portfolio managers in the construction and reallocation of their portfolios under different periods, most notably under COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukrainian war.

@article{tiwari_quantile_2022,
	abstract = {The spillover effect is a significant factor impacting the volatility of commodity prices. Unlike earlier studies, this research uses the rolling window-based Quantile VAR (QVAR) model to describe the conditional volatility spillover between energy, biofuel and agricultural commodity markets. Since the magnitude of connectedness and spillover effects may switch between bearish and bullish market states over time, a QVAR model is a relatively realistic and appropriate approach to capture the connectedness as compared to the mean-based approaches of Diebold and Yilmaz (DY; 2009, 2012, & 2014) which are mostly used in the literature. To this end, we employ volatility estimates by using the realized variance advanced by Parkinson (1980). Specifically, we investigate the time-varying volatility spillovers and connectedness among agricultural markets (wheat, corn, sugar, soyabean, coffee, and cotton), energy markets (gasoline, crude oil, natural gas) and biofuel (ethanol) markets from January 12, 2012 to May 10, 2021. By comparing our empirical analysis with results from the DY spillover model, we establish that connectedness is stronger in the left and right quantiles than those in the mean and median of the conditional distribution, emphasizing the importance of systematic risk spillovers during extreme market movements. Furthermore, results find that volatility spillovers and connectedness in the right tail is higher than in the left tail. In particular, we document significant volatility spillovers from agricultural markets to energy markets during extreme markets conditions and observe the dominance of agricultural markets over energy markets. To ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on the volatility of markets examined, we divide our sample into sub-samples and observe significant variation in the level of volatility spillovers and connectedness across the markets before and during the outbreak of COVID-19. Finally, some useful implications are summarized for investors' portfolios and risk avoidance.},

@article{deng_dynamic_2024,
	abstract = {The spillover effect between multiple markets is crucial in influencing the volatility of energy and food commodity prices. In this study, a time-varying QVAR model is used to analyze the impact of the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war on the risk-associated system of oil, food, and renewable energy, and the DY spillover index model and wavelet coherence are introduced for result comparison. Specifically, data on oil, food commodities, and renewable energy from March 1, 2013, to January 31, 2023, are used, along with various influencing factors such as the climate change index, geopolitical risk, green bond index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average index, to analyze the dynamic correlations presented in the market from multiple perspectives. Furthermore, the ATT-CNN-LSTM model is utilized to construct a risk early warning system for oil-food-renewable energy, providing insights into the future trends of risks. Empirical results indicate that the correlation at the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles is significantly greater than that at the conditional mean and median, indicating higher systemic risk spillover levels during extreme market conditions. We also find that the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war has promoted the development of renewable energy and enhanced the correlation between food and renewable energy. The results of the extension analysis show that the predictive performance of the ATT-CNN-LSTM model is superior to the other five models. This research will contribute to more effective risk management of the energy-food system.},

@article{raza_forecasting_2023,
	abstract = {Economic policy is a major determinant of investment and financial decisions; Moreover, prices of precious metals are highly influenced by any uncertainty recorded in the global economic policy. Therefore, the prime consideration of the authors is to assess how global economic policy uncertainty influences the volatility of precious metals prices; particularly ``gold, palladium, platinum, and silver'' in the pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research analyzed the full sample period (the 1997--2022), pre-COVID period (1997--2019), and during the COVID period (2020−2022) to evaluate the impact during different sample periods. Therefore, the GARCH-MIDAS approach is employed at the data set of different frequencies, i.e., monthly data of GEPU and daily data of precious metals. The results reveal a significant nexus between global GEPU and precious metals price volatility. The findings infer that any uncertainty recorded in global economic policy escalate the price volatility of gold, palladium, platinum, and silver prices. The present study increments the existing literature and provides insights for future scholars, investors, and policymakers.},

Many additional measures have thus been proposed to `level the playing field' and to protect the competitiveness of European energy-intensive industries within the larger effort of reducing Europe's greenhouse gas emissions and of meeting its obligations under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. This article evaluates a range of proposed measures based on a set of political and legal criteria, including environmental effectiveness; the need to consider differentiated commitments, responsibilities and capabilities; conformity with world trade law and European Union law; and Europe's overall political interests. We discuss measures that could be adopted by the European Union and its member states, such as direct support for energy-intensive industries, restrictions of energy-intensive imports into the European Union through border cost adjustments, quotas or technical regulations, and cost reimbursement for affected developing countries. We also analyse measures available to multilateral institutions such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and the World Trade Organisation. We conclude with a classification of the discussed measures with red (unfeasible), yellow (potentially feasible) or green (feasible) labels.},

	abstract = {To improve the precision of carbon price forecasting, our study aims to propose a novel hybrid forecasting model which integrates recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. First, the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) algorithm is employed to decompose carbon prices into several regular intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual. Second, multiscale entropy is utilized to differentiate and reconstruct these components to reduce cumulative errors in subsequent forecasting. Subsequently, a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) equipped with attention mechanisms is used to forecast each reconstructed component. Attention mechanisms identifies crucial sequence elements, assigns different weights to hidden information, and extracts richer information from the series. Finally, the results of all components are integrated to obtain the final forecasting result. Empirical analysis conducted on real datasets from the Guangdong and Hubei carbon markets demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model outperform prevailing mainstream forecasting models in terms of both horizontal and directional forecasting metrics.},

@article{corfee-morlot_global_2007,
	abstract = {Although the science of global warming has been in place for several decades if not more, only in the last decade and a half has the issue moved clearly into the public sphere as a public policy issue and a political priority. To understand how and why this has occurred, it is essential to consider the history of the scientific theory of the greenhouse effect, the evidence that supports it and the mechanisms through which science interacts with lay publics and other elite actors, such as politicians, policymakers and business decision makers. This article reviews why and how climate change has moved from the bottom to the top of the international political agenda. It traces the scientific discovery of global warming, political and institutional developments to manage it as well as other socially mediated pathways for understanding and promoting global warming as an issue in the public sphere. The article also places this historical overview of global warming as a public issue into a conceptual framework for understanding relationships between society and nature with emphasis on the co-construction of knowledge.},

We study the long-term capacity expansion decision in fossil fuel and renewable technologies when electricity demand is uncertain. We model a relevant tradeoff: a higher share of renewable production can be priced at the higher marginal cost of fossil fuel production, yet the likelihood of achieving higher profits is reduced because more electricity demand is met by cheaper renewable production. We illustrate our theoretical results comparing the optimal solutions under a busi-ness-as-usual scenario and under an ETS scenario. This illustration shows under which limiting market settings a monopolist prefers to withhold investments in renewable energy sources, highlighting the potential distortionary effect introduced via an ETS. Our conclusions remain unaltered under varying key modelling assumptions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This study explores the predictive effect of climate change attention on carbon futures returns. Using climate‐related Google Trends and news, we construct five dimensions of the public climate attention index and media climate attention index. After feature selection, we incorporate the optimized combination with lagged order into the machine learning model to predict EU Emission Allowance futures returns. Our empirical results show that the forecasting models with climate attention outperform the corresponding benchmark models, indicating that climate attention does provide predictive information for carbon futures returns. In addition, we carry out trading simulations to investigate the economic performance of the forecast results. It turns out that the market strategies based on the prediction models with climate attention can deliver more benefits than the counterpart market strategies. More specifically, the cumulative returns reach 140\% during the out‐of‐sample period, much higher than 79\% of the cumulative returns of the buy‐and‐hold strategy.},

@article{hart_scientific_1993,
	abstract = {This paper presents a case study of the role of scientific {\'e}lites in mediating between science and politics, securing support for research and shaping the interests of the rank and file. We apply a `garbage can' model, which posits that science, policy and politics typically evolve in separate, unconnected streams, each with its own momentum. In this model, {\'e}lites may act strategically as `policy entrepreneurs' to take advantage of occasional temporary opportunities, or `windows', to influence the policy and science streams. Our case study is of US policy toward research related to the Greenhouse Effect, from the International Geophysical Year in 1957 to the aftermath of the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment.
              1
              We trace the evolution of two research programmes - carbon-cycle research and atmospheric modelling. The major political strategies followed by the relevant {\'e}lites connected with these programmes were concerned with the pursuit of professional autonomy, with weather modification and with environmentalism. Changes in {\'e}lite strategy followed mainly from events outside science, in the policy and politics `streams', rather than from scientific findings.},

@article{laing_assessing_2013,
	abstract = {As an increasing number of countries, regions, cities and states implement emissions trading policies to limit CO2 emission, many turn to the experience of the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, the largest greenhouse gas emissions trading system in operation. The aim of this paper is to survey the body of literature developed over the past eight years of the scheme's existence, particularly those focusing on three key challenging areas of evaluation: (1) emissions abatement in relation to the balance with economic objectives; (2) investment and innovation impacts; and (3) profits and price impacts. Among the key conclusions is that the lack of flexibility in the structure of the EU ETS cap, and its inability to adjust to radically altered wider economic conditions in the shape of the financial crisis, threatens to undermine its efficacy in providing incentives for abatement.},

The aim of this paper is to focus on the daily price changes during 2005 in an attempt to examine the underlying rationality of pricing behaviour. Specifically, we study the effect of those weather and non-weather variables that academic and market agents consider as the major determinants of the of CO₂ price levels. The results show that the energy sources are the principal factors in the determination of CO₂ price levels, and that only extreme temperatures influence them.},

The objective of this paper is to provide empirical evidence on the effect of the EU ETS on firm-level economic performance. There is a growing body of empirical literature that investigates the effects of the EU ETS on firm economic performance, with mixed results. Differently from the previous literature, we test the effect of the EU ETS on a larger set of indicators of economic performance: employment, average wages, turnover, value added, markup, investment, labour productivity, total factor productivity and ROI. Our results, based on a large panel of European firms, provide a broad picture of the economic impact of the EU ETS in its first and second phases of implementation. Contrarily to the expectations, the EU ETS did not affect economic performance negatively. Results suggest that firms have reacted to the EU ETS by passing-through costs to their customers on the one hand and improving labour productivity on the other hand.},

@article{oberndorfer_costs_2007,
	abstract = {In this paper, we analyse different approaches that are available in order to assess the impacts of the EU ETS on costs and competitiveness in Europe. In this respect, we focus on existing simulation studies. We have identified the choice of the reference scenario as the most critical issue for an appropriate analysis of the relevant approaches. We find, however, that effects of the scheme on costs and competitiveness are modest, even given the business as usual case that does not take the legally binding framework of the Kyoto Protocol into account. Furthermore, the impacts of the EU ETS are smaller than the impacts of alternative Kyoto-based regulation scenarios. Compared with these other regulation methods ETSs can have positive competitiveness effects. However, the EU ETS is not designed to boost Europe's economy. Its prime purpose and justification is to ensure that Europe's CO2 emissions are brought down and Kyoto targets are reached at minimal costs. In our opinion, it is therefore important that the system as well as modifications to it do not undermine the environmental goals associated with this policy instrument.

The story of how scientists reached that conclusion---by way of unexpected twists and turns---was the story Spencer Weart told in The Discovery of Global Warming. Now he brings his award-winning account up to date, revised throughout to reflect the latest science and with a new conclusion that shows how the scientific consensus caught fire among the general world public, and how a new understanding of the human meaning of climate change spurred individuals and governments to action.},
